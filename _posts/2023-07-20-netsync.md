- The networking library is Mirror: a high level Networking library for Unity, optimized for ease of use & probability of success. To make connections between clients and sending data we need to traverse NATs: we use SteamWorks API matchmaking and networking interface for that. One player in the party is assigned as a host (client + server) and the others are client-only.
- a Multiplayer boss encounter requires to synchronize all their abilities and movements with all clients. For this I created an event & animation system that is robust against (network) time skips. Mirror takes care of synchronizing a time variable. This network time is used to animate the boss NPC. First we determine which event is currently active based on the network time. Then we determine how far along we are inside the event in terms of time.
- These animations can also have physics attached, like moving platforms for example. Physics objects work best when they driving by forces instead of setting their position and rotation. That is why we use the drawing mesh as the target for the collision meshes. The collision meshes follow the drawing meshes with spring forces for position and rotation.

In the world of multiplayer online gaming, one of the most exciting and challenging aspects is the ability to engage in boss encounters with your friends. These epic battles require precise synchronization of abilities and movements across all players to ensure a seamless and immersive experience. In my game, [Mad Adventures](/mad-adventures), a multiplayer online party game featuring mini-games and boss fights, achieving network synchronized boss encounters was a crucial goal. In this blog post, I will delve deeper into the techniques and systems I implemented to accomplish this feat.

## Leveraging the Power of Mirror

To achieve seamless multiplayer experiences, I relied on Mirror, a high-level Networking library specifically designed for Unity. Mirror offers optimized ease of use and a high probability of success when it comes to networked gameplay. By utilizing Mirror, I was able to establish connections between clients and efficiently send data across the network.

NAT traversal, the process of establishing connections between clients that are behind Network Address Translations (NATs), can be a complex challenge. To overcome this hurdle, I employed the SteamWorks API matchmaking and networking interface, which seamlessly integrates with Mirror. This combination allowed players to connect and communicate with each other, even if they were behind different NATs. In each party, one player was assigned as the host, acting as both a client and a server, while the remaining players served as clients.

## Robust Event and Animation System

Synchronizing the abilities and movements of a boss character across multiple clients requires a robust event and animation system. To address this, I developed a system that could withstand potential network time skips, ensuring consistent and accurate synchronization.

Mirror takes care of synchronizing a time variable across the network, which I utilized to animate the boss NPC. The first step in achieving synchronization is determining which event is currently active based on the network time. This allows all clients to be aware of the current state of the boss encounter. Once the active event is identified, we calculate how far along we are within that event in terms of time. This information is vital for properly animating the boss character on each client's screen, ensuring all players observe the same sequence of movements.

## Physics Integration for Interactive Animations

Incorporating physics into animations adds an extra layer of realism and interactivity to boss encounters. For instance, you may have moving platforms or other physics-driven objects in your boss battles. However, handling physics objects in a networked environment requires careful consideration to maintain synchronization across all clients.

To achieve synchronized physics interactions, I adopted an approach that prioritizes using forces to drive the behavior of physics objects, as opposed to directly setting their positions and rotations. In this setup, the drawing mesh serves as the target for collision meshes. By applying spring forces to the collision meshes, we can ensure they follow the drawing mesh's position and rotation accurately.

This method not only facilitates the synchronization of physics-driven animations but also enhances the overall gameplay experience by allowing players to interact with dynamic elements within the boss encounters.

<!-- ## Conclusion

Designing and implementing network synchronized multiplayer boss encounters presents a unique set of challenges. By leveraging the power of the Mirror Networking library and utilizing SteamWorks API for NAT traversal, I was able to establish stable connections between clients and facilitate smooth communication.

To ensure accurate synchronization of boss abilities and movements across all clients, I developed a robust event and animation system that accounts for potential network time skips. Additionally, by integrating physics-based animations and applying spring forces to collision meshes, I achieved realistic and interactive boss encounters that maintain synchronization throughout the networked gameplay.

Creating captivating multiplayer experiences in *Mad Adventures* required meticulous attention to detail and a deep understanding of network synchronization. Through the implementation of these techniques and systems, players can engage in thrilling and immersive boss battles, forging unforgettable memories with their friends.

So, gather your party and prepare to face the ultimate challenges in *Mad Adventures* â€“ where network synchronization brings boss encounters to life in a truly exhilarating fashion! -->
