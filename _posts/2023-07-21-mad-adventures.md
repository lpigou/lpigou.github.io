I solo-developed the multiplayer game [Mad Adventures](https://store.steampowered.com/app/1840660) in 2022. It's a chaotic multiplayer party platformer with boss fights and party-wide progression. You need to survive a brutal 4-day expedition in order to reach the final boss encounter and unlock party-wide powers and lobby upgrades. You can work together or betray each other at your desire.
